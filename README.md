# hackman

So here's the deal...
cli.py will contain my barebones implementation of hangman using the API. I'm not really sure if I have time to implement anything else but that's okay.

## Future Plans (Time Permitting)
- Make the CLI with a more robust CLI library
    - Thinking PyInquirer
- Javascript Web App
    - Database tracking for word specific history
    - Letter history
    - Leaderboard
    - Time trial mode
    - Have pretty graphics

## Python Requirements
- None at the moment...
